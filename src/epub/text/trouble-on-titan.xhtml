<p class="ph1">CHAPTER I<br>Von Zorn Is Perturbed</p>
<p>Whenever Von Zorn, chief of
Nine Planets Films, ran into
trouble he automatically started
the televisors humming with calls for Anthony
Quade. The televisors were humming
now. In fact they were shrieking hysterically.
Quade’s code number bellowed out
through a startled and partially deafened
Hollywood on the Moon.</p>
<p>Von Zorn, teetering on the edge of his
chair behind the great glass-brick desk, was
throwing a fit.</p>
<p>“You can’t do this to me!” he yelped into
the transmitter, his scrubby mustache bristling
with outrage. “I know you can hear
me, Quade! It’s a matter of life and death!
<i>Quade!</i>”</p>
<p>A covey of anxious secretaries winced
involuntarily as he swung the chair around.</p>
<p>“<i>Get Quade!</i>” he screamed. “Bring me
Quade! All you do is stand around with
your mouths open. I—” He paused, the
light of an unpleasant idea dawning across
his face. He was grinning disagreeably as
he switched the televisor to a private wavelength.</p>
<p>“I’ll fix <i>him</i>!” he muttered. “I’ll—oh,
hello.” This to the face that flashed onto the
screen before him. Rapidly Von Zorn spoke
to the face. It nodded, smiling grimly.</p>
<p>Afterward Von Zorn leaned back and called
for a drink.</p>
<p>“Nine Planets on the brink of ruin,” he
growled into the tilted glass, “and Quade
runs out on me. I’ll fire him! I’ll blackball
him all over the System! But not till he
does this job.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tony Quade, relaxing comfortably
in a seat at the Lunar Bowl, listened
to a distant orchestra in the depths
of the crater crash into the opening strains
of the <i>Star Symphony</i>. Under his coat a
pocket televisor was buzzing shrill commands.</p>
<p>Quade chuckled and shifted his big-boned
body more comfortably in the padded chair.
Kathleen Gregg, beside him, smiled in the
dimness and he told himself that she was
prettier than ever.</p>
<p>It was to her credit that she loathed the
title of “The System’s Sweetheart” which an
enthusiastic publicity department had bestowed
upon her. She was one of Nine
Planets’ brightest stars and Tony Quade was
in love with her.</p>
<p>“Hello, stupid,” he said lazily. “You look
worried. Anything wrong?”</p>
<p>“I suppose you know what you’re doing,”
Kathleen murmured. “Of course, Von Zorn’s
only been calling you half an hour.”</p>
<p>The cries from the pocket televisor had
been all too audible, Quade realized. He
grinned largely and laid an arm along the
back of her chair.</p>
<p>“Let him yell.”</p>
<p>“It must be important, Tony.”</p>
<p>“I,” said Quade, “am resting. Shooting
<i>Star Parade</i> was hard work. I need a rest.
Anyhow, it’s much too nice a night to listen
to Von Zorn.”</p>
<p>“It is nice,” the girl agreed. She glanced
around them. This was the topmost tier of
the Lunar Bowl. At their feet the long rows
of seats swept down endlessly to the central
platform far below, where an orchestra sat
in the changing play of varicolored searchlights.</p>
<p>Behind these uppermost seats stretched
Hollywood on the Moon, the strangest city
in the Solar System. The wonder of Hollywood
on the Moon does not quickly fade,
even to eyes that have seen it often. It is
a garden metropolis on the far side of
Earth’s satellite, in a gigantic valley bounded
by the Great Rim.</p>
<p>Here the film studios had built their city,
washed by an artificially created, germ-free
atmosphere, anchored in the crater by electro-magnetic
gravity fields maintained in the
caverns below. Far distant, the Silver Spacesuit
glowed with pale radiance, the broad,
white-lit expanse of Lunar Boulevard
stretching past it toward the Rim.</p>
<p>From somewhere above a beam of light
shot suddenly downward full upon them.
Blinded, Quade and Kathleen looked up,
seeing nothing at all. Then, without any
warning, Quade arose and floated starward.</p>
<p>Kathleen made a quick, involuntary snatch
at his vanishing heels, missed, and cried distractedly.</p>
<p>“<i>Tony!</i>”</p>
<p>From somewhere above his voice spoke
with annoyance.</p>
<p>“They’ve got a gravity beam on me. I
could get loose, but I’d break my neck.”
The sound trailed off into a distant murmur.
“I’ll murder Von Zorn for this....”</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Quade felt solid metal beneath his feet.
The beam faded. Blinking, he looked
around. This was the lower lock of a police
ship. Black-clad officers were wheeling away
the great anti-gravity lens. A man with a
captain’s bars took his finger off the button
that had closed the lock and looked at Quade
speculatively.</p>
<p>“What’s the idea?” Quade demanded
crossly.</p>
<p>“Sorry, sir. We’re looking for a Moonship
stowaway. You answer his description.”</p>
<p>“My name’s Quade. I don’t suppose you’d
even look at my credentials.”</p>
<p>The captain looked blank.</p>
<p>“Might be forged, you know. We can’t
afford to take chances. If you’re Tony Quade,
Mr. Von Zorn can identify you.”</p>
<p>“He will,” Quade said between his teeth.
“Yeah—he will!”</p>
<p>Five minutes later they stood in Von
Zorn’s office. The film executive looked up
from a script and nodded coldly.</p>
<p>“Tell him who I am,” Quade said in a
weary voice. “I’ve got a date.”</p>
<p>“It’s not as easy as that. You’re either
Quade or a Moonship stowaway. If you’re
Quade I’ve got to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a date. Also, I quit.”</p>
<p>Von Zorn ignored this.</p>
<p>“If you’re not Quade it means jail, doesn’t
it?” He glanced at the captain, who nodded.</p>
<p>Quade thought it over. Of course he could
get out of jail without much trouble, but not
perhaps for some hours. Besides, he was
beginning to wonder what mishap had occurred.
It must be pretty serious.</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said. “I’m Quade. Now tell
your stooge to rocket out of here.”</p>
<p>Von Zorn nodded with satisfaction, waved
the captain away and pushed toward Quade
a box of greenish, aromatic Lunar cigars.
Quade pointedly lit one of his own cigarettes
and sat down in a glass-and-leather chair.</p>
<p>“Shoot.”</p>
<p>But Von Zorn wasn’t anxious to begin.
He took a cigar, bit the end off savagely,
and applied flame. Finally he spoke.</p>
<p>“Udell’s dead.”</p>
<p>Quade was startled. He put down his
cigarette.</p>
<p>“Poor old chap. How did it happen?”</p>
<p>“In the Asteroid Belt. A meteor smashed
his ship. He was coming back here from
Titan. A patrol ship just towed his boat in.”</p>
<p>Quade nodded. He had met Jacques Udell
only a few times, but he’d liked the eccentric
old fellow, who was somewhat of a genius
in his own fashion. A scientist who had
turned to film-making, he had once or twice
created pictures that had amazed the System—like
<i>Dust</i>, the saga of the nomad Martian
tribes.</p>
<p>“All right.” Von Zorn punctuated his sentences
with jabs of the cigar. “Get this, Tony.
Last month Udell sent me a package and a
letter. In the package was a can of film.
I ran it off. He’d filmed the Zonals.”</p>
<p>“That’s been done before—for what it’s
worth. They’re sub-humans, aren’t they?
Not much story-value there.”</p>
<p>“They’re the queerest race in the system.
Ever see one? Wait till you do—you won’t
believe it! Udell worked some sort of miracle—he
really got a story. The Zonals acted
in it for him. Intelligently!”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t seem possible.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t. But Udell did it. He shot one
reel and sent it to me with the scenario.
It’s a good story. It’ll be a smash hit. I
bought the pic on the strength of the first
reel. Paid plenty for it. I’ve sent out advance
blurbs and it’s too late to call them all back
now.”</p>
<p>“Udell didn’t finish?”</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Von Zorn shook his head.</p>
<p>“He was on his way back here for
some reason or other, with two more reels
finished, when a meteor cracked him up.
The reels are spoiled, of course. Udell didn’t
have sense enough to insulate ’em.”</p>
<p>Von Zorn snapped his cigar in two.</p>
<p>“I own the picture. I paid him for it. But
he was the only man who knew how to make
the Zonals work for the camera. See the
catch, Tony?”</p>
<p>“You want me to finish the pic. A nice
easy job. Why not fake the rest of it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t dare,” Von Zorn admitted frankly.
“I’ve already blurbed this as the real thing.
It’d raise too big a howl if we used robots. I
can imagine what that Carlyle dame would
do.”</p>
<p>Quade grinned maliciously.</p>
<p>“Catch-’em-Alive” Carlyle, interplanetary
explorer extraordinary, was Von Zorn’s vulnerable
point, his heel of Achilles.</p>
<p>“She’s suing me,” Von Zorn said, breathing
audibly. “For libel. Says the <i>Gerri Murri</i>
cartoons are libelous.”</p>
<p>“Well, aren’t they?” Quade asked. This
animated cartoon series, depicting Gerry Carlyle
as an inquisitive bug-eyed Venusian
<i>Murri</i>, had proved immensely popular with
everybody but Gerry. She had created a
fair-sized riot in Froman’s Mercurian Theatre
when she first recognized her counterpart
on the screen.</p>
<p>“We won’t discuss that—that—” Von Zorn
gulped and finished weakly, “that tomato.
Do you want to see Udell’s film on the
Zonals?”</p>
<p>“Might as well,” Quade agreed, getting up.
“I may get some ideas about his method.”</p>
<p>“You’d better get some ideas,” Von Zorn
said darkly, “or we’ll all be in the soup.”</p>
<hr class="chap">
<p class="ph1">CHAPTER II<br>Trip to Titan</p>
<p>The next morning Quade went to the
spaceport to examine Udell’s wrecked
ship, which had arrived in tow a few hours
before. Von Zorn was with him and at the
last moment Kathleen, scenting something
interesting, attached herself to Quade’s elbow
and would not be dislodged.</p>
<p>Quade was not entirely happy about her
presence, because of a vague uneasiness he
could not name. He had hunches like that
occasionally. He felt one strongly now about
the wrecked ship and the dangers that might
lie dormant there.</p>
<p>“You see, silly, nothing’s wrong,” Kathleen
said impatiently as they stood in the great
torn hole that had been the ruined ship’s side.
The vessel, a small, six-man job, was warped
and twisted grotesquely by the impact of the
meteor, which had ripped completely through
the walls of the control room and emerged
into space on the other side. The bodies had
been removed, but nothing else was yet
touched.</p>
<p>“All the same,” Quade told the girl uneasily,
“I don’t like it. I wish you’d stay
outside.”</p>
<p>“Ha!” Kathleen said in a sceptical voice
and ducked her curly head under the torn
wall to peer inside. “Nothing here. Don’t
be such a sissy, Tony. What could possibly
hurt me?”</p>
<p>“How can I tell? All I know is, wherever
you go there’s trouble. Stand back now and
let me take a look.”</p>
<p>But he found nothing. Even a careful
search of the interior disclosed little to warrant
that feeling that something more serious
had happened here than a mere chance
accident with a meteor. The only thing that
puzzled him was the wreckage in the ship.</p>
<p>Bottles, instruments, gauges, seemed
smashed more thoroughly than they should
be, considering the impact of the meteor.
Furniture was splintered, not only in the
control room but in every other part of the
vessel.</p>
<p>“I don’t get this,” Quade said slowly. “The
meteor didn’t cause all this damage. It
looks—” He hesitated. “It looks as though
Udell and his men had gone on a spree. But
there’s no sign of liquor on the ship.”</p>
<p>“Oxygen jag?” Von Zorn suggested.</p>
<p>Quade examined the tanks.</p>
<p>“No, it doesn’t look like it. They didn’t
even use oxygen to try to save themselves.
Look—they could have blocked off the control
room with airtight panels and released
oxygen. Or they might at least have got
into their spacesuits. There must have been
time for that. I’ve got a hunch—”</p>
<p>Von Zorn was examining the cans of film,
the casings intact but the film itself spoiled
by exposure.</p>
<p>“Eh?” he said. “You have a theory?”</p>
<p>“An idea, that’s all. If Udell and the navigator
had been in their right minds, they
needn’t have collided with the meteor. Look
here—the automatic repulsors are smashed.
That’s what caused the trouble.”</p>
<p>“In their right minds?” Von Zorn echoed
slowly. “Space-<i>cafard</i>?”</p>
<p>“Hitting all of ’em? Hardly! Is a postmortem
being done?”</p>
<p>Von Zorn nodded.</p>
<p>“The report ought to be ready by now if
you want to check up.” He chewed his cigar
savagely. “If only one man of the crew had
lived! We’ve got a smash hit dumped on
our laps and goodness knows if we can
even film it.”</p>
<p>Kathleen put her head through a wrenched
door-frame. She was a little pale.</p>
<p>“Really, Tony, it’s rather horrible. I hadn’t
realized—I never saw a space wreck before.”</p>
<p>“Let’s get on the televisor,” Quade said
decisively. “I’d like to check on the postmortems.”</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>He swung out through the half-fused
port, and the others followed him into
the Patrol office. A few minutes’ conversation
with the authorities was all that was necessary
when Von Zorn used his name. Then
a gaunt face above a white jacket dawned
on the screen. There were introductions.</p>
<p>“Did you find anything out of the ordinary?”
Quade asked.</p>
<p>The reflected head shook negatively.</p>
<p>“Well, not what you’d expect, anyhow.
The crash certainly killed them all, if that’s
what you mean. No question of foul play.
But—” He hesitated.</p>
<p>“But what?”</p>
<p>“Antibodies,” said the man reluctantly.
“Something new. I can’t get any trace of
a virus. Apparently some disease attacked
the men. Their systems built up antibodies
that I never encountered before. Something
funny about the neural tissues, too. The
cellular structure’s altered a little.”</p>
<p>Von Zorn thrust his head toward the
screen.</p>
<p>“But what was it? That’s what we want
to know. Were they conscious when they
died?”</p>
<p>“I think not. My theory is that Udell and
his crew were attacked by some disease
native to Titan. Maybe the same disease
that turned the Zonals into idiots.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to go to Titan myself,” Quade
said slowly. “Suppose we work there in
spacesuits. Could a virus get through metal
or glass?”</p>
<p>“I think you’d be safe. Mind you, that’s
just my opinion. There’s such a thing as a
filterable virus, you know. But, judging by
the antibodies, I’d say there’d be no risk if
you wore spacesuits constantly, outside your
ship.”</p>
<p>“It won’t be easy,” Quade said, “but it’s
better than infection.”</p>
<p>“We’ve taken tests of the wrecked ship,”
the man in the screen told them. “No trace
of any unusual disease-germ or virus. We’ve
tested samples on protoplasmic cultures and
got nothing but the ordinary bugs present
everywhere. Sorry I can’t tell you more.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay,” Quade said. “Thanks.” He
clicked off the televisor. “All right, then.
We film <i>Sons of Titan</i> in spacesuits.”</p>
<p>Kathleen looked worried.</p>
<p>“I—I don’t like it, Tony. Do you have
to—”</p>
<p>“Can’t leave a flicker like that unfinished,”
Quade said. “I saw the reel Udell sent in.
It’s magnificent theater. The tragedy of the
Zonals—one of the biggest epics the System
ever saw. They used to be highly civilized
at one time, historians think, but something
wrecked their brains.</p>
<p>“They’re decadent now, little better than
animals. If I can film the rest of <i>Sons of
Titan</i>, we’ll have something really big—<i>Grass</i>
and <i>Chang</i> and <i>Dust</i> all rolled into
one. <i>If</i> I can figure out how to make the
Zonals act.</p>
<p>“They acted for Udell—magnificently.
They lived their roles. And that’s what’s so
mysterious, Kathleen. The Zonals aren’t
really smart enough to come in out of the
rain.”</p>
<p>“Could it have been faked?” the girl asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Von Zorn said decisively. “No
question of robots. Udell made ace actors
out of—of sub-idiots. The question is how?”</p>
<p>“Same way you did with that new crooner
you’re starring, maybe,” Quade said rather
sardonically. He was examining a slip of
paper. “I picked this up in Udell’s ship—it’s
a list of supplies he planned to get in Hollywood
on the Moon. That’s probably why he
came back from Titan—he ran out of some
things he needed. Let’s see. Why did he
want neo-curare?”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Von Zorn asked.</p>
<p>“Derivative of curare. A poison that paralyzes
the motor nerves. I didn’t know the
Zonals had nerves.”</p>
<p>“Their neural structure’s atrophied, Tony.
Mm-m. What else is on that list?”</p>
<p>“Cusconidin, Monsel’s Salt, sodium sulphoricinate,
a baresthesiometer, lenses, filters,
camera stuff—nothing special in the medical
supplies Udell wanted. You’ve got to jazz
up the pharmacy when you’re in space, anyhow.
Your katabolism changes, and so on.
Variant drugs—”</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Von Zorn spoke abruptly.</p>
<p>“There was something about a degenerate
race of Zonals that attacked Udell’s
party, I think. An outlaw tribe. They had a
high resistance to wounds; pretty invulnerable.
Neo-curare’s a fast-working poison,
isn’t it?</p>
<p>“Well—there’s your answer. Special ammunition
against that particular tribe in case
they attacked again. Udell probably intended
to smear neo-curare on his ammunition.”</p>
<p>“Could be,” Quade said. He hesitated,
thumbed a button and called Wolfe, his
assistant, on the televisor. The youngster’s
thin face and sharp blue eyes flashed into
visibility on the screen.</p>
<p>“Hello, Tony. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Got the camera-ship ready for the take-off?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Well, here are some more supplies I want
you to get. Photostat it.”</p>
<p>Quade pressed Udell’s list face down
against the screen. After a moment Wolfe
said, “Got it.”</p>
<p>Von Zorn seized the paper and began
scanning it. Abruptly he emitted the anguished
howl of a disemboweled wolf.</p>
<p>“Wait, Tony!” he cried desperately. “Not
that! Venusian cochineal at a hundred dollars
a pint, current quotation? Use surrogate
red. It’s almost as good, and we don’t
need—”</p>
<p>“I want everything—understand?” Quade
said to the televisor. “Don’t leave out a
thing.”</p>
<p>Stabbed in the budget, Von Zorn spun
toward Kathleen Gregg.</p>
<p>“Next he’ll want diamond lenses and radium
paint for technicolor effects, I suppose.
Thirty-odd concentrated aqueous dyes—and
they won’t even show on the celluloid!”</p>
<p>“The Zonals spend a lot of time underwater,”
Quade said patiently. “And underwater
camera work under alien conditions is
tricky. You’ve got to experiment with the
right dyes and special filters and lenses before
you can get complete submarine clarity.”</p>
<p>“You’ve ordered enough concentrated dye
to color the Pacific,” Von Zorn mourned.
“Lake Erie at least. Why couldn’t Udell have
found the right dye before he broke his
contract?”</p>
<p>“Broke his contract?” Kathleen said wonderingly.
“He didn’t—”</p>
<p>“He’s dead, isn’t he?” Von Zorn snarled
and went off, as Quade rather suspected, to
beat a child star—any child star who wasn’t
big enough to be dangerous.</p>
<p>Quade got busy preparing for the expedition.</p>
<hr class="chap">
<p class="ph1">CHAPTER III<br>Location Site</p>
<p>Being the sixth satellite of Saturn,
Titan is unpleasantly cold. It gets no
heat from its major, since Saturn’s average
temperature is 180° below zero F. But there
are occasional volcanic areas, and in one of
these, amid geysers and steaming lakes, is
the only settlement of humans on Titan, New
Macao, a roaring bordertown.</p>
<p>Most of the moon remains unexplored.
There are continents and islands and iron-cold
seas whose vast depth as well as the
tidal pull of Saturn keep unfrozen. Maps
on the satellite are mostly blank, with the
outlines of the continents sketched in and
a few radar-located landmarks indicated.
Perhaps two dozen mining companies work
some of the volcanic regions.</p>
<p>Equatoria, a continent as large as Africa,
stretches from latitudes 45° north to 32°
south. Udell had clearly marked on his
chart the position of his Titan camp, a valley
near the equator on the outskirts of Devil’s
Range, a broad mountainous belt stretching
across the equator for three hundred miles.</p>
<p>So Quade brought down his camera ship,
a gleaming, transparent-nosed ovoid, in a
five-mile-wide shallow basin clearly of volcanic
origin. Steaming geyser plumes feathered
up from the rocky floor. Towering
cliffs of ice ringed the valley.</p>
<p>In the center a few shacks stood, but there
was no sign of life. Though the atmosphere
was breathable, Quade, remembering the
mysterious virus, issued orders for continual
wearing of spacesuits outside the ship. Moreover,
he installed antiseptic baths in the
spacelocks, in which every member of the
crew had to dunk himself before reentering
the vessel.</p>
<p>“We’re not near New Macao, are we?”
Wolfe asked, a wistful gleam in his blue
eyes as he peered through the transparent
hull.</p>
<p>Quade grinned.</p>
<p>“Nope. We’re on the other side of the satellite.
Why? Thirsty?”</p>
<p>“Kind of.”</p>
<p>“Better stay away from New Macao liquor,”
Quade said solemnly. “Know what
plasmosin is? It’s the fibre that holds the
cells, of your body together. One shot of
Martian absinthe, New Macao version, and
the plasmosin lets go. You fall apart. Very
bad.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” Wolfe said, wide-eyed. “Gee,
I’d like to try it.”</p>
<p>Quade chuckled and glanced at the instrument
panel. “That’s funny,” he said suddenly.</p>
<p>“Eh?” Wolfe followed the other’s gaze.
The needle of a gauge was jumping. “Radiation,
eh?”</p>
<p>“Radiation. Dunno what type. The Geiger
counters are quiet, so it either doesn’t register
or it’s too weak to be dangerous.” Quade
fiddled with the instruments. “It’s coming
from the south. We passed over a good-sized
crater a while back, didn’t we?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It wasn’t volcanic, either.
Meteoric. Suppose there’s a radioactive meteor
buried down under it?”</p>
<p>“Possibly. But it doesn’t look like ordinary
radioactivity. Let’s see.” Quade tested.
“No alpha, beta or gamma types. It’s too
weak to bother us, but have one of the men
check on it. How about going outside? Get
your suit.”</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Outside the ship Quade and Wolfe
sweated in the protective armor, till
the refrigo-thermal systems got hold. Then
they felt better. These were light-weight
outfits, designed for protection against temperature
and poisonous atmospheres, not the
bulky, reinforced spacesuits used in pressure-work.
Saturn was almost at zenith.
Quade looked up at the ringed planet, squinting
against the wan, yet curiously intense
light.</p>
<p>“Have to use special filters,” he remarked.
Diaphragms in the spherical transparent helmets
made it possible to converse. In this
atmosphere it wasn’t necessary to use radio.</p>
<p>Spongy pumice crackled under their feet.
A bellow of crashing ice thundered from the
snowy ramparts to the west. It died and
there was silence. No movement stirred
in the valley. Quade peered from under his
palm.</p>
<p>“There’s a lake,” he said. “The Zonals are
amphibious. Let’s try it.”</p>
<p>If the surface of Titan seemed a bleak
desert, the waters of the satellite provided
a strange contrast. The lake was an oval
nearly a mile long. Its surface seethed and
bubbled with glowing light—no wonder Udell
had wanted to experiment with dyes! Plant-life
made islands on the surface. There was
ceaseless activity in the water and, every
few moments, a bulky glistening body would
appear briefly and vanish again.</p>
<p>Quade hesitated on the edge. There had
been a tribe of dangerous Zonals, he remembered.
In fact, there were several, news
from Macao had told him—nomadic groups
wandering murderously around from sea to
lake to river. But most of the Zonals were
peaceful enough.</p>
<p>And in this lake—</p>
<p>“Tony!” Wolfe said sharply. “Look there!”</p>
<p>A head broke the water a few dozen feet
away. A round, furry head like a seal’s,
with staring eyes. The nose was a snout,
the mouth broad and loose and lipless. But
for all the animalism of the creature, the
curve of its head above the eyes, its obvious
cranial index, showed that it must possess
a brain of some intelligence.</p>
<p>Quade and Wolfe remained motionless.
The water broke into a seething rush of
bubbles and the Zonal came shoreward.
It waded out and stood knee-deep in water,
staring blankly.</p>
<p>Its body was thoroughly anthropoid in outline,
and curiously graceful in its sleekly
furred, streamlined contours. The Zonal was
a little more than five feet tall. Its hands
and feet were huge and webbed.</p>
<p>The Zonal squirted jets of liquid from its
eyes. Then it bent and submerged its head
briefly. Wolfe had involuntarily stepped
back. Quade spoke softly.</p>
<p>“Take it easy. Its eyeballs are hollow—it’s
got an opaque diaphragm stretched over
’em, like a kettle-drum. No lens. There’s a
hole in the center of the diaphragm to admit
light, and the hollow’s kept filled with water.
Acts as a lens. It’s got perfect vision, though.
And—look at that thing on its back!”</p>
<p>The Zonal, having filled its hollow eyes
with water, stood up again, but Quade and
Wolfe had already got a glimpse of the creature’s
flight-sac, a great sausage-shaped object
that made it look humpbacked. The sac
had a gristly projection at one end that suddenly
moved and twisted. The Zonal, tiring
of the two men’s company, disappeared.</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Wolfe was left blinking at the place
where it had been. Quade, who knew
what to expect, looked up. The creature was
shooting through the air like a streamlined
spaceship, thirty feet high and going fast.
Quade pointed it out to his companion.</p>
<p>“Uh!” Wolfe said. “It’s worse than a flea.
How does it do that?”</p>
<p>“Same way a squid does,” Quade explained,
watching the Zonal fall like a stone
toward the ground. A dozen feet above a
mound of gnarled lava the amphibian seemed
to halt in the air, then sank down gently,
to stand quietly surveying its surroundings.</p>
<p>“A squid?”</p>
<p>“Or a cuttlefish. Squirts water out of a
sac—the old repulsion principle. Only the
Zonals are a little more scientific about it.
Those sacs on their back look soft, but
they’re plenty tough.</p>
<p>“They’re filled with gas, continually renewed
and manufactured by letting in air
and water to mix with the chemicals of
their bloodstream. When a Zonal wants to
move fast he lets off a blast that has the
same effect a rocket-jet has on a spaceship.”</p>
<p>“They don’t have gravity screens, though,”
Wolfe said.</p>
<p>Quade smiled.</p>
<p>“Well, no. Here’s this fellow back again.”</p>
<p>The Zonal came flying, bulletlike. Just
before he reached the two men a blast of
hissing, suddenly-released gas braked it and
the creature plumped down easily not a yard
away.</p>
<p>“Wonder if Udell taught ’em English?”
Quade murmured. He put out his hand gently.
“Hello, there. We’re friends—understand?
We’re friends.”</p>
<p>The Zonal touched Quade’s flexible-metal
glove with a tentative, limber finger. Then,
gently gripping it in his webbed hand, he
eyed it carefully, lifted it to his mouth, and
took a hearty bite.’</p>
<p>Quade yelped, jerked his hand back and
nursed a bruised knuckle. The Zonal, seemingly
puzzled, lifted its shoulders in something
suspiciously like a shrug and rocketed
back to the lava mound, where it squatted
down to think things over. Meanwhile a
dozen new heads had popped up from the
lake near the shore.</p>
<p>“I thought you said they weren’t dangerous,”
Wolfe observed.</p>
<p>“They’re not,” Quade gulped, moving his
fingers experimentally. “Ouch! That was
just—ah—curiosity.”</p>
<p>“Well, what now?”</p>
<p>“We’ll unload the equipment. Get the
cameras set up. The Zonals can wait a bit.
I want to think things over.”</p>
<p>Quade was hoping he didn’t sound as
baffled as he felt. He had hoped that Udell
might have educated the amphibians somewhat,
but apparently the creatures were
dumber than apes—a lot dumber. Somehow
that didn’t jibe with the sizable brain-cases
of the Zonals. Their cranial indices seemed
to hint that there was intelligence in those
sleek furry heads—and Udell had managed
to use that savvy. But how?</p>
<p>How, indeed?</p>
<hr class="chap">
<p class="ph1">CHAPTER IV<br>Crackup</p>
<p>Quade had arranged the compact two-man
cruiser as a miniature replica of
the giant camera ship and carrying identical
equipment. It was a complete traveling laboratory,
with built-in cameras and searchlights
that could stab out from every angle
through the transparent nose. During space
flights it remained in its cradle within the
larger vessel, but now it rested on the lava
plain near by, ready for a take-off.</p>
<hr class="chap">
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" src="images/illus.jpg" id="id-1756649969215769597">
</div>
<hr class="chap">
<p>Three days had passed and Quade was
still stumped. He couldn’t penetrate the wall
of stupidity that shielded the Zonals from
all advances. Once or twice he thought he
was making some headway with the first
Zonal they had encountered—whom Wolfe
had irreverently dubbed Speedy. But Speedy,
though extremely curious, shot off like a
rocket whenever Quade felt he was getting
somewhere.</p>
<p>In the great camera-ship Quade was donning
his protective armor. He had decided
to make a survey of the surrounding terrain
in the little cruiser, on the chance that
Udell’s trained Zonals might have wandered
away. The icy rampart was no barrier to
them, for they rocketed over it like birds.</p>
<p>Wolfe, leaning against a table stacked
with experimental apparatus, looked tired.</p>
<p>“Want me to go along, Tony?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You’d better stay here and keep things
moving,” Quade said.</p>
<p>“What things?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. Everything’s ready for
shooting. We could roll any time—except
for the Zonals. I’ve got to find some way—”</p>
<p>Quade, struggling into his suit, lurched
into a cabinet and deftly caught a small bottle
as it fell.</p>
<p>“Neo-curare. Don’t want to smash that.
I may use it on myself if I have to face
Von Zorn without a picture.”</p>
<p>“Tony,” Wolfe said hastily. “I think I see
Kathleen Gregg.”</p>
<p>“<i>What!</i>”</p>
<p>Quade whirled awkwardly, peering through
the ship’s nose. A gyroplane had landed
and a slim figure in gleaming space-armor
was clambering out. It was, indeed, Kathleen.</p>
<p>“<i>Blast!</i>” Quade said, lurching toward a
port. Halfway out he remembered the neo-curare
and hastily stuck it in one of the
self-sealing pockets in his suit. Pumice
ground under his heels. The gyroplane, he
saw, was already surging up, angling toward
the ice barrier. Kathleen was trotting along
briskly, but there was a certain hesitancy
in the look she gave Quade.</p>
<p>He halted in front of the girl. She smiled.</p>
<p>“Why, hello, Tony.”</p>
<p>“Just what are you doing here?” Quade
asked. “Or should I guess?”</p>
<p>“It’s sweet of you to say so,” Kathleen
observed, tilting her nose Saturnward. “As
a matter of fact, I got rather tired hanging
around—”</p>
<p>“So you thought you’d drop in and say
hello,” Quade finished for her. “Now you
can turn around and say goodbye and go
home.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>Quade peered after the departed gyroplane.</p>
<p>“How’d you get here?”</p>
<p>“Took a tramp ship to New Macao and
hired a pilot to fly me the rest of the way.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Quade said. “See that two-man
camera ship? You’re going to march into it
and I’m going to fly you back to New Macao
and put you on a Sunward ship. Catch?”</p>
<p>“Won’t,” Kathleen said, starting to run.
Quade deftly caught her, lifted her kicking
figure, and carried her to the cruiser. He
dumped her in it and turned to Wolfe, who
had followed.</p>
<p>“Be back as soon as I can. Keep things
moving.”</p>
<p>“Right. Hello, Kathleen,” Wolfe said pleasantly.
“Goodbye now.”</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>He shut the port and departed. Quade
silently turned to the controls and lifted
the ship. Kathleen, standing beside him, was
not silent. She finished by saying that her
engagement to Quade was off, and that he
was a rat.</p>
<p>“Sure I am,” Quade said. “But this is my
job and I think it’s a little dangerous. I’m
sure I can handle it. Just the same, I don’t
want you around. For one thing you distract
me and for another I’m still wondering about
that virus disease that killed Udell.”</p>
<p>Kathleen sniffed.</p>
<p>“Ha. Hey! We’re being followed.”</p>
<p>Quade threw a magnifying plane on the
scanner. A sleek projectile was rocketing
along after the camera cruiser.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s Speedy,” Quade said. “One of
the Zonals. He won’t follow us long.”</p>
<p>But this proved inaccurate. Speedy stayed
on the trail for twenty miles before he was
lost in the distance. Then nothing was visible
but the frigid, Cyclopean peaks of the Devil’s
Range, icy and alien in the pale light
of Saturn.</p>
<p>Things began to happen with alarming suddenness.</p>
<p>There are plenty of safety devices on
spacecraft, but these depend on the assurance
that you have a skilful and a conscious operator.
Quade was skilful enough, but unfortunately
he was knocked cold when the
vessel sideslipped in a sudden blast of air,
powerful as a cyclone, that screamed up from
the Devil’s Range. A geyser-heated valley
below made a thermal of racing air that
created a maelstrom where the icy atmosphere
of Titan met it.</p>
<p>The camera cruiser turned sidewise and
Quade went spinning into the controls. His
head banged against his helmet, which made
him lose all interest in the fact that the ship
was plunging down.</p>
<p>Kathleen couldn’t do much about it, though
she tried hard enough. She was wedged
under a tangle of apparatus, which imprisoned
her but saved her from serious injury
when the ship struck, with a splash that
sent water leaping high.</p>
<p>Creamy, luminous liquid crept over the
ship’s nose. An oddly-shaped fish came to
stare in pop-eyed amazement. Then it swam
hastily away.</p>
<p>The ship grounded. Kathleen fought her
way free and scrambled up the tilted floor
to where Quade lay. There was blood oozing
from his head, and Kathleen quickly removed
the helmet and used the first-aid kit.
But Quade remained stubbornly unconscious.</p>
<p>Two courses were left. Kathleen could fly
the ship back to the camp or she could radio
for help. She tried both, but without success.
The controls were smashed, the gravity plates
warped and broken.</p>
<p>The cruiser’s day of usefulness was over.
The radio was hash. A telephoto camera
was strewn in sections about the room and
some of the carboys of concentrate-dye had
torn free from their moorings and were
broken. The floor was awash with yellow
and pink fluid.</p>
<p>Kathleen peered up through the ship’s
nose. The surface of the lake beneath which
they lay wasn’t far above, she judged. If
she could swim up—that would be easy in
the airtight suit. But what about Tony?</p>
<p>He wouldn’t drown in ten seconds. She
inflated both of the suits with oxygen,
dragged Quade into the portal lock and shut
the valve behind her with a futile hope that,
if the atmosphere stayed in the ship, it might
rise of its own accord, or at least that it would
be easier to salvage the equipment. She
opened the outer door and went head over
heels into the rush of water. Somehow she
kept hold of Quade’s arm.</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Luckily, the lock was angled so that
they slid out of their own accord,
buoyed up by the oxygen. Quade, still unconscious,
blew bubbles. With panic beginning
to dry her throat, Kathleen tightened
her grip on his suit and they shot up like
rockets into clear, cool Saturnlight.</p>
<p>Quade was torn away from the girl’s clutch.
She blinked and stared around. He was
floating only a few yards away, his face submerged.
Lying flat on the surface, Kathleen
paddled to him, dragged his head up in the
crook of her arm and awkwardly made for
the shore.</p>
<p>Several sleek objects appeared above the
surface and watched her speculatively. But
they were somewhat different from the Zonals
Quade had already encountered. Their
heads were flattened, their jaws heavier.
Altogether they lacked the suggestion of
good nature and humanity that the other
Zonals had possessed. But they did not
attack, for which Kathleen was duly grateful.
She finally reached the beach and
dragged Quade ashore.</p>
<p>He had swallowed little water, being unconscious,
and with a small gasp Kathleen
sat down beside him, weak with relief and
reaction. She looked around.</p>
<p>They were in a crater perhaps two miles
in diameter, surrounded by overhanging
peaks and glaciers that seemed to be getting
ready to rush down in catastrophic destruction.
This lake, a small one, was in the very
center. Plumes of steam flared up here and
there, indicating geysers.</p>
<p>Underfoot was the eternal lava, rising into
a jungle labyrinth of twisted malformations.
In the distance Kathleen made out a great
black dome, faintly glistening. But she could
not guess its nature.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Zonals were swimming
closer, in a semicircle. They emerged from
the water, dripping, to reveal another way
in which they differed from Quade’s Zonals.
The sacs on their backs were shrunken and
atrophied.</p>
<p>Kathleen found it difficult to believe that
the creatures were harmless. She was eying
the long, curved claws on the webbed hands,
and the tusklike, capable teeth bared by
retracted lips. If she had been alone she
would not have waited to face the amphibians.
As it was, Quade lay unconscious
beside her. Neither of the two was armed.</p>
<p>The Zonals slipped closer. There was,
Kathleen thought, unmistakable menace in
their attitude. Growls rumbled from their
throats. These weren’t Udell’s tame Zonals,
that was certain.</p>
<p>Hastily Kathleen looked about for a weapon,
but all she could find was a good-sized
lava chunk. Hefting this, she stood up,
waiting.</p>
<p>The Zonals, emerging from the water,
closed in. Their growling was louder now.
One amphibian was in the forefront; Kathleen
could see him sinking lower as his
furry legs bent and he tensed for a spring.</p>
<p>She hurled the rock.</p>
<p>The amphibian dodged easily. He sidled
forward, and behind him came the others.</p>
<p>A man’s voice shouted. There was the
vicious crack of a whip. Again the harsh
voice roared a command. The Zonals hesitated—and
Kathleen looked back hastily to
see a giant figure, clothed in rags, coming
forward. Gray-shot red hair bristled wildly.
His face was turned toward the Zonals, but
the heavy broad shoulders spoke of enormous
strength.</p>
<p>The whip cracked. The man bellowed an
order.</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Snarling, the Zonals drew back. Suddenly
they broke and fled to the lake.
The man stood waiting till they had submerged
and then turned to Kathleen. He
stood quietly facing her, the whip hanging
lax.</p>
<p>And something in his face made the girl
shiver a little. The features were strong
enough, even harshly handsome. But the
glacial black eyes were—disturbing. There
was no trace of expression in them. They
stared like glazed jet marbles, cool and
remote.</p>
<p>“My name’s Milo Sherman,” the man said.
He glanced at the unconscious Quade.</p>
<p>As Kathleen opened her mouth, Sherman
halted her with an upraised palm.</p>
<p>“Better talk as we go. The Zonals are
dangerous.” He laughed unpleasantly.
“They’re afraid of me, but I take no chances.
Come on.” He bent, hoisted Quade to his
shoulders and started toward the glistening
dome Kathleen had already glimpsed. “Now
talk,” he commanded.</p>
<p>Kathleen talked.</p>
<p>“I see,” Sherman said as they rounded a
shoulder of lava. “You’re unlucky. However,
you’ll be safe for a while. There’s my castle,
see?”</p>
<p>Fifty feet away the building loomed, a
dome-shaped structure as high as a six-story
building. It seemed to be built of some
gleaming black substance, broken at intervals
by round gaps. Sherman marched forward,
straight toward a blank wall.</p>
<p>No—not entirely blank—there was an inch-wide
hole in it. And the hole began to
broaden as they approached, opening till it
was a gaping portal.</p>
<p>They stepped across the threshold. Behind
them the hole shrank again, like a sphincter.
They were in a large room, bare except for
a sloping ramp that led up to a gap in the
ceiling. A row of luminous spots glowed
in the walls.</p>
<p>Sherman went up the ramp. Kathleen
was behind him, a little troubled now, conscious
of some unknown danger. Above, the
room was larger, lighted by similar lightspots
in the walls. It was filled with a clutter
of junk—chairs, tables—some of them twisted
and broken—most of them rusty.</p>
<p>“Salvage,” Sherman said. He went to a
corner, dropped Quade into a shallow depression
in the floor and tossed his whip
aside. Quade’s body sank down a few inches,
as though into an air mattress.</p>
<p>“Well, take off your helmet,” Sherman said
coolly. “Make yourself at home. You’ll be
here for life—since there’s no way of getting
out of this valley!”</p>
<hr class="chap">
<p class="ph1">CHAPTER V<br>Perilous Valley</p>
<p>Kathleen sat down limply on a rusty
chair that squeaked under her weight.
Her fingers felt cold and clumsy as she
unscrewed her helmet, deflated the spacesuit
and shook her hair free.</p>
<p>“No way out?” she said. “We could
climb—”</p>
<p>“You could try it,” Sherman said, “till
you got tired. The glaciers wall us in. And
they crumble. I broke my arm six years ago
trying to escape.”</p>
<p>“Six years!”</p>
<p>“I’ve been here seven,” Sherman told her.
“I’m the last survivor of the patrol ship
Kestrel, wrecked while making a forced
landing in the Devil’s Range. Three of us
escaped with our lives from the crash—the
ship’s doctor, myself and another patrolman.
Their graves are down the valley a bit.”
His eyes were blank.</p>
<p>“Seven years here, with the Zonals gradually
losing their fear of me. They multiply
faster than I can kill them. Now I’ve got
about eight rounds of ammunition left—no,
nine, I see.” He showed an old-fashioned
pistol.</p>
<p>“But the camera crew will search for us.”</p>
<p>“A tiny valley in three hundred miles of
mountains? And your friends won’t know
where to look, from what you say? For all
they know, you might have crashed anywhere
on Titan.”</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>“I’d forgotten something. You’ve got to be
inoculated immediately. Otherwise you’ll just
go crazy and die.”</p>
<p>Kathleen blinked. “Huh?”</p>
<p>“The plague—the one you say killed that
man Udell and his crew. It nearly killed us
before the <i>Kestrel’s</i> doctor got on the track.
You’ve got the virus in you now.”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible,” the girl said. “Unless
we were infected since we cracked up.”</p>
<p>“You were infected before you ever landed
on Titan,” Sherman said grimly. “The
virus is a protein molecule that exists in
living organisms—Zonals and humans alike.
Usually it’s harmless—a recessive characteristic.
But under the influence of a certain
kind of radiation the virus becomes actively
malignant.”</p>
<p>“I don’t get it.”</p>
<p>Sherman had talked a good deal with the
Kestrel’s doctor before the latter died. He
told Kathleen about the tobacco mosaic
disease—how a plant, suffering from common
mosaic disease, may suddenly become victim
of a more virulent form—<i>acuba</i>—caused
when the basic molecules change their structure.</p>
<p>“It’s like that,” he said. “There’s a meteor
on this continent which emits rays that develop
the latent, harmless virus in one into
the active, malignant form. That’s what
originally wrecked the minds of the Zonals,
you know.” He noticed Kathleen’s pallor.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry too much about it. I’m still
alive, you see. Our doctor worked out a
cure. The Zonals have antibodies in their
bloodstreams—antibodies strong enough to
immunize a human. They developed ’em,
but not in time to save themselves from degeneration.
I prepared a fresh batch of
serum yesterday—so come along and I’ll
inoculate you.”</p>
<p>“But—will Tony—”</p>
<p>“He’ll be safe here. The Zonals don’t dare
come into my castle.”</p>
<p>Kathleen followed Sherman through another
of the sphincter doors. She was thinking
of Wolfe and his crew. They were also
exposed to the meteoric radiation—which
would eventually kill them unless they were
warned and immunized.</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>But when Kathleen told Sherman, he
merely shrugged.</p>
<p>“We’re in prison here. No radio. No way
of communication. Your ship’s under water
and wrecked. So—” He picked up a hypodermic
syringe. “You and your friend—what’s
his name, Quade?—you’ll be safe
enough, unless the Zonals kill us. They
can’t come in here.”</p>
<p>“This building? Who made it, anyway?”</p>
<p>“The Zonals,” Sherman said. “A long time
ago. They were a plenty intelligent race
before the meteor landed and the plague hit
them. I’ve got an idea there used to be a
lot of these castles on Equatorial—bigger
ones than this, too. It’s not exactly a building,
though. It’s alive.”</p>
<p>“Alive? How?”</p>
<p>“Hard to believe, isn’t it? I guess there’s
nothing like these castles anywhere else in
the System.”</p>
<p>“The studio biologists make robot animals,”
Kathleen said doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Yeah? These castles were made by the
Zonals once—to live in. As though a lot of
blood corpuscles had got together and built
a man to live in. These castles don’t wear
out and they don’t need electricity or air
conditioning—they’ve got everything. Notice
how fresh the air is?”</p>
<p>“I hadn’t. But I do now.”</p>
<p>“That’s air conditioning. The castles
breathe—they take in air, filter out the
harmful bugs and cool or heat or humidify
it if necessary. You don’t need windows for
light, with those eye-spots in the walls.”</p>
<p>The syringe was ready. Sherman made an
awkward but careful injection in Kathleen’s
arm.</p>
<p>“You’re safe enough now,” he said.
“You’re immune. But you’ll need occasional
booster shots. I’ll fix up your friend next.
Look around the castle if you want—it’s
safe enough, as long as you don’t go outside.”
He refilled the syringe and departed.</p>
<p>Kathleen sat down to wait for the inoculation-shock
to wear off. It was some time
later when she heard a confused clamor
from outside. Hastily she rose, found the
weakness had passed and hurried to the
room where she had left Quade. He still
lay unconscious, the syringe at his side and
a wad of cotton still sticking to his bare arm.
Sherman was gone.</p>
<p>Outside the yelling of the Zonals stilled.
Sherman’s voice rose. The growling began.
It rose to a roar. The whip cracked violently,
but the noise did not stop, though it sank
to a harsh murmur.</p>
<p>Presently Sherman came back into the
room, dragging his whip. His eyes were
bleak as ever, but a muscle was twitching
under his eye. Without pausing he said,
“You’ve set off the Zonals.”</p>
<p>“I did? How?”</p>
<p>“Ever since I landed here the food supply
in the lake has been diminishing. Before
that, too, I suppose—but it got below the
danger point not long ago. The lake’s nearly
cleaned out. There’s another little pool ’way
up at the end, but that’s empty too, now.</p>
<p>“The Zonals are hungry. Which adds up
to the fact that they figure we’re good to
eat. I told ’em to go catch fish—there must
be a few left—but they didn’t understand
me, of course.”</p>
<p>Kathleen gulped. Sherman grinned at her.
He went through one of the sphincter doors
and came back with the whip in one hand
and a long knife in the other.</p>
<p>“I may have to fight,” he said. “Our little
friends are getting anxious outside. Here’s
my gun. If they get past me—use it.”</p>
<p>The next ten minutes were far too long.
It was impossible for Kathleen to guess
what was happening outside; she could only
listen to the muffled snarling and the incessant
crack of Sherman’s whip. Once
Quade moaned and stirred and she turned
hastily to him, but it was a false alarm.</p>
<p>Sherman backed into sight. He was retreating
very slowly, using both the lash and
his knife. Beyond him the Zonals pressed
forward, snarling.</p>
<p>“Shall I shoot?” Kathleen asked softly.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Sherman said without turning.
“Save it till—”</p>
<p>He stopped talking, for the Zonals’ growling
rose to a roar. They flooded forward into
the room, forcing Sherman to give ground.
He swung his whip—and it was caught,
dragged from his hand. He went down under
the rush of the amphibians.</p>
<p>Then the creatures were everywhere. Before
Kathleen had a chance to fire, the gun
was knocked out of her grip. The Zonals
moved far faster than she had anticipated.
She struck out desperately, hearing Sherman’s
hoarse curses as he slugged and
battled under a mound of Zonals.</p>
<p>And just then the gun exploded. A concerted
wave of panic caught the amphibians.
They gave ground as the gun crashed again.</p>
<p>It was Quade, on his feet now, placing
his shots accurately. The Zonals were beginning
to drift toward the door, a movement
that grew into flight and then to panic.
In a minute or less the room was empty
except for the three humans.</p>
<p>Sherman got up, rocking unsteadily.</p>
<p>“Lucky I didn’t use the gun much,” he
said. “They’re plenty afraid of it. But we’re
out of ammunition now.”</p>
<p>“A fine thing to wake up to,” Quade said,
sitting down and turning a pale green.
“What’s been going on? Kathleen—”</p>
<p>She told him.</p>
<hr class="chap">
<p class="ph1">CHAPTER VI<br>Poisoned Javelins</p>
<p>It was indeed alarming news.</p>
<p>“Unarmed, eh?” Quade said when she
had finished. Sherman had gone out of the
room, but now he came back in time to hear
the words. He was carrying a bundle of
sharpened metal rods.</p>
<p>“Only these,” he said. “I ground ’em a
long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Javelins? Mm-m.” Quade dug into a
pocket of his spacesuit. “Neo-curare,” he
said, bringing out the bottle. “Lucky I
brought it along. If we smear some of this
stuff on the points, it ought to account for
a few Zonals. It’s a fast-acting poison. Anything
going on outside?”</p>
<p>There was nothing. They stood in the
castle’s door-sphincter. As it automatically
widened, the barren wilderness of the valley
became visible. No Zonals were in sight.
The lake glowed phosphorescently in the
distance.</p>
<p>“Here comes something,” Kathleen said.</p>
<p>With a swish and a thump something
rocketed into view, plumping down just outside
the threshold. Quade stopped Sherman’s
lifted javelin-arm.</p>
<p>“Hold on. He’s not dangerous. This is
Speedy, one of my tame Zonals. He must
have trailed us here.”</p>
<p>It was Speedy, all right and Speedy was
staring with wild curiosity at Quade and the
others. The contrast between this amphibian
and the degenerate Zonals of the valley was
marked. The fangs and claws of the decadent
tribe didn’t show in Speedy, and his
high-arched cranium hinted at intelligence,
not brutal ferocity alone.</p>
<p>“Pencil and paper, quick!” Quade said.
“We’ve got a carrier pigeon here!”</p>
<p>Sherman vanished. He reappeared in a
moment, bearing a small metal cylinder and
a length of wire as well as writing equipment.
Quade hastily scribbled a note, thrust
it into the cylinder and cautiously approached
Speedy.</p>
<p>The Zonal almost got away, but was betrayed
by his suspicion that Quade’s hand
was good to eat. Quade held the amphibian
firmly while he fastened the cylinder to
Speedy’s body and tried to keep his hands
out of reach of the nibbling mouth at the
same time.</p>
<p>“Hope he doesn’t know how to untie
knots,” Kathleen said. “How about it, Tony?
Will he head back for the camp?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Quade said. “Still, that’s
where he lives.” He released the Zonal.
“Blow. Take a walk. Rocket off!”</p>
<p>Speedy reached for the metal tube. Quade
yelled and clapped his hands, and the amphibian
rocketed away in alarm. He came
down fifty feet away, near a mound of lava
and went to work on the wire.</p>
<p>Quade started toward him, running. From
behind the lava block came two of the decadent
Zonals, closing in on poor Speedy.
He didn’t see them until too late, and then
he went down under the rush, fighting with
feeble valor.</p>
<p>Quade stopped. He couldn’t reach the
battle in time, but he still held a poisoned
javelin. He hurled it at the struggling group.</p>
<p>Speedy yelped, waving a bleeding arm
grazed by the metal point. Quade was a
poor marksman with this unfamiliar weapon.</p>
<p>But Sherman was a better one. His javelin
struck one of the attacking Zonals and got
him through the heart. The other, taking
alarm, fled.</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Speedy lay limp and unconscious. Quade
started to run again, hearing footsteps
behind him. He felt slightly sick. The last
chance for escape was gone now. Then his
eye caught a flicker of motion. Speedy
wasn’t dead. He grunted, stood up, swaying,
and stared around.</p>
<p>A yelling came from the lake.</p>
<p>“Come on,” Sherman said urgently. “Let’s
get back to the castle. We haven’t a chance
here in the open.”</p>
<p>Speedy suddenly rocketed away. Quade
saw him land beside Kathleen at the castle’s
doorway. The two men fled, hearing the
thud of racing feet and the roars of the
Zonals rising in volume. They reached the
castle—and Quade got the shock of his life.</p>
<p>“They try kill us, yes?” an unfamiliar
voice said hoarsely.</p>
<p>Quade looked at Kathleen, then at Sherman.
They, too, were staring. Again the
voice repeated its question. Slowly Quade
turned to meet the unblinking gaze of
Speedy.</p>
<p>“This bad place,” the Zonal said. “Better
go.”</p>
<p>“He talked,” Kathleen murmured unbelievingly.
“He’s intelligent, Tony!”</p>
<p>“Intelligent,” Speedy repeated. “Yes. Your
language hard. But Earth man Udell taught
us some words. Speak.”</p>
<p>Quade swallowed.</p>
<p>“Yeah. You speak, all right. But how?
Have you been playing dumb all along?”</p>
<p>Speedy looked puzzled.</p>
<p>“Earth man Udell stick us with needle.”</p>
<p>“That’s it,” Quade said abruptly. “So that
was Udell’s trick!” He glanced around. “We
can’t get out. Our ship’s wrecked. Understand?”</p>
<p>Speedy nodded.</p>
<p>“Understand. I get help.”</p>
<p>“You know where the camp is?”</p>
<p>“I know. I go there now. Tell men—bring
them here. Yes.”</p>
<p>He rocketed up and was gone. His sleek
figure was visible swooping toward the ice
barrier. Then he had crossed it and vanished.</p>
<p>“Let’s go inside,” Quade said. “I’d hate it
if the Zonals ate us before Wolfe got here.”</p>
<p>Inside the castle Quade divided the javelins
and passed them around.</p>
<p>“One mystery’s solved,” he said. “There
won’t be any trouble in filming Sons of Titan
now. The Zonals are intelligent—but it takes
a shot of neo-curare to make ’em that way.”</p>
<p>“A poison?” Kathleen asked. “Spill it,
Tony.”</p>
<p>“A poison to us, not to the Zonals. They’ve
a different sort of physiology. The neo-curare
doesn’t hurt ’em. It just liberates
their subconscious.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Sherman said.</p>
<p>“Here’s the angle. Scientists got on the
track a long time ago—’way back before
nineteen-forty. They experimented with a
dog—trained him to do certain things at the
sound of a bell, a conditioned reflex, you
know. Then they doped him with curare
and developed other habit-patterns in his
brain, also set in action by the bell.</p>
<p>“They proved the two had two independent
behavior-systems in his mind—that
both could be trained to react to the same
stimulus and do it independently of each
other. It works like that with the Zonals.”</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Kathleen blinked. Quade went on.</p>
<p>“It’s logical enough. The virus that
wrecked the Zonal culture ruined only their
conscious mind—made ’em idiots. Their subconscious
minds weren’t harmed. They still
retain their potential power. But they’re
subconscious, of course—blanketed.</p>
<p>“The neo-curare simply inhibits the higher
centers of the brain, the part that was
wrecked by the virus, and releases the subconscious.
And while that’s in control the
Zonals are intelligent! This will mean rehabilitation
for the whole race, someday.
Udell taught and trained ’em while they
were doped with neo-curare.</p>
<p>“So all we have to do is follow Udell’s
lead. When we get back to camp we’ll first
of all immunize the men with the antivirus
and then break out the neo-curare. We can
finish <i>Sons of Titan</i> in a few weeks!”</p>
<p>“You forgot something,” Sherman said.
“One of the degenerate Zonals got inoculated
with neo-curare too, just now.”</p>
<p>“Well, the javelin also went through his
heart,” Quade said. “You can’t be smart
when you’re dead. I dunno about that but
I’ve got a suspicion the neo-curare won’t
have the same effect on these Zonals of
yours. They’re so decadent that even their
subconscious may be bestialized.</p>
<p>“They’re almost a different race, as far
beneath the regular Zonals as a hyena is
beneath a human being. We can try it out
and now’s our chance, because they’re attacking
again. So we can’t wait till Wolfe
arrives. Kathleen, our ship’s wrecked, isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” the girl said dubiously. “The
plates are smashed.”</p>
<p>“Um. I may be able to do some repair
work. It’s worth trying. Your helmet’s
okay, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Kathleen nodded.</p>
<p>“But you’re not going outside, are you?”</p>
<p>Quade was donning his spacesuit. He
pulled the transparent helmet into place.</p>
<p>“I am,” he said through the diaphragm.
“Our javelins won’t keep the Zonals off long
unless the neo-curare will do the trick—and
I’m going to find out. At worst, even if our
ship’s wrecked, there’s a gun or two in the
cabin.” He turned to Sherman. “Take it easy.
Luck.”</p>
<p>“I’m going with you,” Kathleen decided.</p>
<p>“There’s only one helmet,” Quade informed
her. “I’ll be safe enough in this
spacesuit. You stay here till I get back,
understand?”</p>
<p>“All right,” the girl said obediently and
Quade departed.</p>
<p>“First time in her life she ever did what
I told her,” he thought, plodding toward the
lake. This job was going to be dangerous,
regardless of what he had told Kathleen.
If the Zonals attacked—</p>
<p>He went on. A number of the Zonals
trailed him. One ran forward, and Quade
spun quickly and threw his javelin. He
didn’t want to kill. He was making an experiment.
The sharp-ground point ripped
into the amphibian’s leg and the Zonal fell
instantly.</p>
<p>Quade waited. After a minute or more
the creature hoisted itself laboriously upright.
It had fallen behind its fellows, who
were still following Quade.</p>
<p>It ran after them, limping. Its low snarling
mingled with the menacing noises of the
others. One glimpse of the amphibian’s
brutal face told Quade that his guess had
been right. These Zonals were so decadent
that not even neo-curare could make them
intelligent.</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Shrugging, he turned to the lake. A
gleam of metal told him the location of
the sunken spaceship. Quade waded in. The
luminous water seethed about his knees,
his waist—closed over his helmet. That didn’t
matter. The chemicals in the suit supplied
plenty of air.</p>
<p>He saw the ship, a black shadow, looking
like a great resting shark on the bottom.
Thanks to the luminosity of the water it was
surprisingly clear; he could make out details
easily. And now he could hear noises
that must mean pursuit. The Zonals, he
thought, were amphibians.</p>
<p>They swam down, keeping a safe distance
for the time as Quade manipulated the space-lock.
As the Zonals saw him disappearing
they came in fast. Quade got another javelin
from his belt and used it efficiently.</p>
<p>But after that he was reduced to using his
fists, which was not too effective under
water. The Zonals began dragging him out
of the lock. Quade reached out, caught a
lever, and tried to anchor himself. He
couldn’t.</p>
<p>But inside the ship there were weapons.</p>
<p>He struck out frantically at another lever.
The inside port opened. The sealed ship became
unsealed in an instant, and the lake
poured in, carrying with it Quade and a
dozen Zonals. By the time the water had
settled, a steady stream of amphibians were
swimming down through the open lock, and
the water had changed color to streaky yellow
and pink that gradually merged into an
ambiguous darker hue.</p>
<p>Briefly puzzled, Quade noticed that two
carboys of the concentrated aqueous dye had
been smashed. Also, Kathleen had left the
ship’s lights on, so the Zonals, temporarily
distracted, were able to see Quade and to
converge on him.</p>
<p>They got him down, clawing at his suit
with their talons. That didn’t worry him.
The armor was tough. But one of the Zonals,
after breaking a tooth on Quade’s helmet,
got a bright idea. He found a metal bar
somewhere and began smashing it down on
Quade’s head. He used it like a piston, so
that water pressure was minimized, and the
helmet began to show a webwork of fine
cracks.</p>
<p>Quade twisted, got hold of the bar and
tussled it free. He levered oxygen into his
suit hurriedly. Buoyancy took over, and he
shot up out of the heap of Zonals and
bounced off the ceiling. But the amphibians
instantly swam up after him.</p>
<p>It was then that Quade noticed the row of
carboys in their wall-cradles beneath him....</p>
<p>He broke them. Using the metal bar, he
floundered and fought and smashed his way
through the Zonals down the line, while blue
and green and translucent orange flowed out
from the carboys, staining the water brilliantly.
It was tremendously concentrated,
this aqueous dye.</p>
<p>And, while each dye had been made to
blend transparently with water, there is a
simple principle of the color-wheel that added
up to complete opacity. If you mix a lot
of colors, you get black. This wasn’t dead
black, but it was darker and thicker than a
Venusian fog on Darkside.</p>
<p>Within moments the Zonals were fighting
by touch alone. Luckily for Quade, they had
no scent-organs worth mentioning, or could
not use them under water. And they did not
know the spaceship, while Quade could have
found his way from bow to stern blindfolded.</p>
<p>He was blindfolded. But the Zonals were
in a worse predicament as Quade found
when he opened the arsenal, abstracted a
few weapons and dodged his way out of the
dun-colored lake to shore. Some of the amphibians
were emerging on land, but they
were wandering around vaguely, with helpless,
groping motions.</p>
<p>They had hollow eyeballs and used water
for lenses. Thus, since they’d sucked in the
dark-dyed lake-water by now, they were
blinded until they could find clear liquid of
some sort!</p>
<hr class="tbk">
<p>Hordes of them were emerging from
the lake. They were grouping together
now, stumbling up the valley toward the
pool at the upper end. There they could regain
their vision. But it would take time,
and Quade, his arms loaded with blasters
and thermo-pistols, grinned tightly and
started back toward the castle.</p>
<p>No Zonals were visible when he reached
it. Kathleen and Sherman ran forward to
meet him. Quade let the guns fall.</p>
<p>“Wait’ll I take off this suit,” he said, and
unzipped himself. Sherman was lovingly
loading the weapons as Kathleen helpfully
tried to pull off Quade’s helmet without
loosening the bolts.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Quade said, beating her off. “I’ll
do it. There! Now. Let me tell you what
happened.” He explained. Sherman whistled.</p>
<p>“Blind man’s buff! That should hold the
Zonals for a while. They’ll be all right after
they get to the upper pool and rinse their
eyeballs out, but it’ll take a while. And with
these guns—” He touched a thermo-pistol
with expert fingers. Then, suddenly, he
looked at Quade.</p>
<p>“I just thought—I hadn’t realized it before!
I’ll be getting out of here! After seven
years—”</p>
<p>The big shoulders shook.</p>
<p>“I’ll take this gear inside,” Sherman said.</p>
<p>He didn’t finish. Carrying the guns, he
went into the castle and the portal shrank
behind him.</p>
<p>“Give him time,” Quade said slowly. “Let’s
wait here for the ship.”</p>
<p>So they did. And when it loomed over the
glaciers Kathleen sighed, relaxed against
Quade’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Now we’re all set, huh?”</p>
<p>“Right,” Quade told her. “Because you’re
going back Sunward with Sherman. He’s
got to report to Patrol headquarters and I’m
going to have him take you with him.”</p>
<p>“<i>Tony!</i>” Kathleen said reproachfully. “You
don’t love me any more!”</p>
<p>“I adore you madly,” Quade said, ignoring
the sputtering girl as he signaled the approaching
ship. “You hate me. Our engagement’s
broken again. You’ll get Von Zorn
to blacklist me. You’ll elope with a crooner.
I know exactly what you’re trying to say.
Just the same, you’re going Sunward with
Sherman. I’ve got a picture to shoot! You
hear me?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Tony,” murmured Kathleen,
who was already laying new plans. “But I
just happened to remember. What about the
Planetary Quarantine laws? We’ve all been
infected with this Titan virus and, even
though we’ve got the antitoxin, we’ve got to
stay on Titan for thirty days—or is it sixty?
Don’t look at me like that! I can’t help it,
Tony—honest I can’t—it’s the law—!”</p>
